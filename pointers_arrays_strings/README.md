# C - Pointers, Arrays and Strings

This project focuses on understanding and implementing pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming.

## Description

This project explores fundamental concepts in C programming related to memory manipulation through pointers, array usage, and string handling. These concepts are core to efficient C programming and form the basis for more advanced data structures.

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding what pointers are and how to use them
- Learning about arrays and how they relate to pointers
- Differences between pointers and arrays
- How to use and manipulate strings in C
- Scope of variables in C programming
- Understanding memory addresses and pointer arithmetic
- How to navigate and modify data in memory directly

## Tasks

1. **0-reset_to_98.c** - Function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98
2. **1-swap.c** - Function that swaps the values of two integers
3. **2-strlen.c** - Function that returns the length of a string
4. **3-puts.c** - Function that prints a string to stdout
5. **4-print_rev.c** - Function that prints a string in reverse
6. **5-rev_string.c** - Function that reverses a string
7. **6-puts2.c** - Function that prints every other character of a string
8. **7-puts_half.c** - Function that prints half of a string
9. **8-print_array.c** - Function that prints n elements of an array of integers
10. **9-strcpy.c** - Function that copies the string pointed to by src to the buffer pointed to by dest

## String Manipulation Tasks

11. **0-strcat.c** - Function that concatenates two strings
12. **1-strncat.c** - Function that concatenates two strings, using at most n bytes from src
13. **2-strncpy.c** - Function that copies a string
14. **3-strcmp.c** - Function that compares two strings
15. **4-rev_array.c** - Function that reverses the content of an array of integers
16. **5-string_toupper.c** - Function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase
17. **6-cap_string.c** - Function that capitalizes all words of a string
18. **7-leet.c** - Function that encodes a string into 1337

## Requirements

- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- Code must follow the Betty style
- No global variables allowed
- Maximum of 5 functions per file
- No standard library functions allowed except those specified in the requirements
- Prototypes of all functions should be included in a header file called `main.h`

## Memory Concepts

- A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable
- Arrays are contiguous memory blocks that store elements of the same data type
- Strings in C are arrays of characters terminated by a null byte (`\0`)
- Understanding memory layout is essential for effective pointer and array manipulation

## Note

Mastering pointers, arrays, and strings is fundamental to C programming. These concepts allow for efficient memory use and form the foundation for more advanced data structures and algorithms.
