# Holberton School Low Level Programming

This repository contains various projects completed as part of the Holberton School curriculum, focusing on low-level programming concepts using the C language.

## Project List

### C Basics
- **hello_world**: Introduction to C programming, compilation process with gcc, and basic syntax
- **variables_if_else_while**: Control flow with conditionals and loops
- **functions_nested_loops**: Function declarations, definitions, and nested loop structures
- **more_functions_nested_loops**: Advanced function implementations and nested loop applications

### Memory Management
- **pointers_arrays_strings**: Fundamentals of memory addresses, pointer arithmetic, arrays, and string manipulation
- **more_pointers_arrays_strings**: Additional practice with pointer concepts and string operations
- **even_more_pointers_arrays_strings**: Complex applications and 2D arrays

### Memory Allocation
- **malloc_free**: Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation
- **more_malloc_free**: Advanced memory management techniques
- **realloc_concept**: Memory reallocation and resizing

### Programming Concepts
- **recursion**: Implementation and application of recursive algorithms
- **static_libraries**: Creating and using static libraries in C
- **argc_argv**: Handling command-line arguments
- **preprocessor**: Using the C preprocessor, macros, and header files
- **structures_typedef**: Creating and working with custom data structures
- **function_pointers**: Working with pointers to functions
- **variadic_functions**: Functions with variable number of arguments

### Development Tools
- **makefiles**: Creating and using Makefiles for project compilation
- **debugging**: Finding and fixing bugs in C programs

### Data Structures
- **singly_linked_lists**: Implementation and manipulation of singly linked lists
- **doubly_linked_lists**: Implementation and manipulation of doubly linked lists
- **hash_tables**: Creating and using hash tables in C

### Bitwise Operations
- **bit_manipulation**: Performing operations at the bit level
- **file_io**: File input/output operations in C

## Technical Requirements

- All programs written in C
- Compiled on Ubuntu LTS with gcc using the flags: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic
- Code follows the Betty style guide
- No global variables used unless specified
- Limited use of standard library functions, focus on building from scratch
- Function prototypes included in header files

## Skills Developed

- Algorithmic thinking and problem-solving
- Memory management and manipulation
- Efficient data structure implementation
- Understanding of compiler and build processes
- Debugging techniques
- Code organization and documentation
