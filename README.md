Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming
This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm track at Holberton School. In these projects, which occurred throughout the duration of the Year 1 curriculum, I learned about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working in the C language. The specific list of projects contained follows:

Hello, World
Variables, if, else, while
Functions, nested loops
More functions, more nested loops
Pointers, arrays and strings
More pointers, arrays and strings
Even more pointers, arrays and strings
Recursion
Static libraries
argc, argv
malloc, free
More malloc, free
Preprocessor
Structures, typedef
Function pointers
Variadic functions
printf
Singly linked lists
More singly linked lists
Bit manipulation
File I/O
Simple Shell
Doubly linked lists
Dynamic libraries
Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
Hash tables
Sorting algorithms & Big O
Makefiles
Binary trees
Search Algorithms
