# C - Recursion

This project focuses on understanding and implementing recursion in C programming.

## Description

This project explores the concept of recursion, where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem. Recursion is a fundamental concept in computer science and is used to solve problems that can be broken down into similar subproblems.

## Learning Objectives

- What recursion is and how to use it
- How to implement recursive functions in C
- The difference between iteration and recursion
- How to handle base cases and recursive cases
- Understanding stack overflow and how to avoid it

## Tasks

1. **0-puts_recursion.c** - Function that prints a string, followed by a new line, using recursion
2. **1-print_rev_recursion.c** - Function that prints a string in reverse using recursion
3. **2-strlen_recursion.c** - Function that returns the length of a string using recursion
4. **3-factorial.c** - Function that returns the factorial of a given number
5. **4-pow_recursion.c** - Function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y
6. **5-sqrt_recursion.c** - Function that returns the natural square root of a number
7. **6-is_prime_number.c** - Function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0

## Requirements

- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- Code must follow the Betty style
- No global variables allowed
- Maximum of 5 functions per file
- No standard library functions allowed except those specified in the requirements
- Prototypes of all functions should be included in a header file called `main.h`

## Note

Mastering recursion is essential for solving many algorithmic problems and for understanding how function calls work in C.
