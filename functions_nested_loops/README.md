# C - Functions, Nested Loops

This project focuses on understanding and implementing functions and nested loops in C programming.

## Description

This project covers fundamental concepts in C programming including function declarations, nested loops, scope of variables, and header files. The tasks involve creating various C programs that demonstrate understanding of these concepts.

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding what nested loops are and how to use them
- How to declare and define functions
- The difference between declaration and definition of a function
- What is a prototype and how to use function prototypes
- Scope of variables
- What are header files and how to use them with `#include`
- Understanding the gcc flags `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89`

## Tasks

1. **0-putchar.c** - Program that prints `_putchar`, followed by a new line
2. **1-alphabet.c** - Function that prints the alphabet in lowercase
3. **2-print_alphabet_x10.c** - Function that prints the alphabet 10 times
4. **3-islower.c** - Function that checks for lowercase character
5. **4-isalpha.c** - Function that checks for alphabetic character
6. **5-sign.c** - Function that prints the sign of a number
7. **6-abs.c** - Function that computes the absolute value of an integer
8. **7-print_last_digit.c** - Function that prints the last digit of a number
9. **8-24_hours.c** - Function that prints every minute of the day
10. **9-times_table.c** - Function that prints the 9 times table
11. **10-add.c** - Function that adds two integers and returns the result
12. **11-print_to_98.c** - Function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98

## Requirements

- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- Code must follow the Betty style
- No global variables allowed
- Maximum of 5 functions per file
- No standard library functions allowed (like printf, puts, etc.) except _putchar
- Prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in a header file called `main.h`

## Custom _putchar Function

For this project, we are using a custom `_putchar` function to print characters. This function is similar to the standard library's putchar but is implemented for educational purposes.

## Note

Understanding functions and nested loops is essential for building more complex programs, as they allow for code reusability and handling repetitive tasks efficiently.
