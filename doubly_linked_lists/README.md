# C - Doubly Linked Lists

This repository contains my projects for learning and implementing doubly linked lists in C.

## Repository Structure

- `0-print_dlistint.c`  
  Prints all the elements of a doubly linked list.

- `1-dlistint_len.c`  
  Returns the number of elements in a doubly linked list.

- `2-add_dnodeint.c`  
  Adds a new node at the beginning of a doubly linked list.

- `3-add_dnodeint_end.c`  
  Adds a new node at the end of a doubly linked list.

- `4-free_dlistint.c`  
  Frees a doubly linked list.

- `5-get_dnodeint.c`  
  Returns the nth node of a doubly linked list.

- `6-sum_dlistint.c`  
  Returns the sum of all the data (n) of a doubly linked list.

- `7-insert_dnodeint.c`  
  Inserts a new node at a given position.

- `8-delete_dnodeint.c`  
  Deletes the node at index of a doubly linked list.

## Key Concepts

- Doubly linked list structure and manipulation
- Dynamic memory allocation and freeing
- Traversal, insertion, and deletion in linked lists

## Usage

To compile and run any file:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic file.c -o file
./file
```

Replace `file.c` with the actual file you want to test.

## Requirements

- All programs are written in C and tested on Ubuntu.
- Code follows Holberton School guidelines and Betty style.
