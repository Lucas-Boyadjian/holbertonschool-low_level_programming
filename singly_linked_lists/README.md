# C - Singly Linked Lists

This repository contains my projects for learning and implementing singly linked lists in C.

## Repository Structure

- `0-print_list.c`  
  Prints all the elements of a singly linked list.

- `1-list_len.c`  
  Returns the number of elements in a singly linked list.

- `2-add_node.c`  
  Adds a new node at the beginning of a singly linked list.

- `3-add_node_end.c`  
  Adds a new node at the end of a singly linked list.

- `4-free_list.c`  
  Frees a singly linked list.

- `main.h`  
  Header file containing function prototypes.

## Key Concepts

- Singly linked list structure and manipulation
- Dynamic memory allocation and freeing
- Traversal, insertion, and deletion in linked lists

## Usage

To compile and run any file:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic file.c -o file
./file
```

Replace `file.c` with the actual file you want to test.

## Requirements

- All programs are written in C and tested on Ubuntu.
- Code follows Holberton School guidelines and Betty style.
